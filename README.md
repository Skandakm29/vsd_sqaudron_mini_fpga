##  Setup & Installation
### **Install the required tool chain**
~~~
sudo apt update
~~~
### **Install synthesis, P&R, bitstream, and debugging tools**
~~~
sudo apt install -y \
  yosys \
  nextpnr-ice40 \
  icestorm \
  iverilog \
  gtkwave \
  picocom \
  make \
  git
~~~

### **Clone the Repository**

After installing the required tools, **clone this repository**:

    git clone https://github.com/Skandakm29/vsd_sqaudron_mini_fpga.git

Navigate into the repository:

    cd vsd_sqaudron_mini_fpga

***


### **Navigate to the Specific Project**

Each project has its own directory. Navigate to the project you want to work on:

Example:

    
    cd VsdSquadron_mini_fpga_uart_loopback

To view available files:

    
    ls
    

***


### **Clean Previous Builds**

Before starting a new build, clean old files using:

```sh
sudo make clean
```

This removes any previous bitstream files.

***


### **Build the FPGA Bitstream**

To **synthesize the design and generate the bitstream**, run:

    sudo make build

This will execute:

- **Synthesis (Yosys)**
- **Place & Route (NextPNR)**
- **Bitstream Generation (IceStorm)**

***


### **Flash the FPGA**

Once the bitstream is built, upload it to the FPGA using:

```sh
    sudo make flash
```
This command programs the **VSD Squadron Mini FPGA board**.
